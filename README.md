# Drivers_development_MSP432P401R
Repository for the embedded driver development for MSP432P401R in Code Composer Studio

Hi! This is a short project that I'm making to gain expertise in the embedded driver development world. 
In this case I'm using a MSP432P401R from Texas Instruments. I will try to make the drivers for PORTS, I2C,
SPI and eUSCI.
